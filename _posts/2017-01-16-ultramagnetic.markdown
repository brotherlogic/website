The other side of the project for this year is to listen to 10 classic Hip Hop
records that have, so far, not really made an impression on me. And we start
here with The Ultramagnetic MCs' Critical Beatdown. And so, on a week where
I travelled from Oakland to Mountain View each day, I gave this one a pretty
good listen but I still don't think I quite get it - I like it for sure, but
I think there's some way to go on this journey.

I'm trying to learn to play the drum intro for Cinnamon Girl at the moment - it's
a one bar, 8 note set up with alternating snare and bass drum. But the eighth note
is empty, just a hanging silence before the beat starts up over again. And the
rhyming style of Ultramagnetic MCs is just that - a torrent of words and then
nothing, before starting up over again. The beats are tough, all Synthetic
Substitution type Ultimate Breaks but packed in tight. They're a weird mix of
both hardcore old school rap styles but the content is all over the place and
veers between bragging and surrealism. And the line "I'm hype. For the Critical
Beatdown" is one of the best.
