Ice Cube and The Bomb Squad - together at last!. And my god does this kick off
right from the get go. A club banger of a beat and Cube showing everyone
how's its done. I always found the Bomb Squad a bit too weighty when backing
Public Enemy - but here Cube ups the tempo and punches each rhyme hard and it
delivers.

There's the tedious slices of bragging about women which detracts a little but
besides that, this is a solid effort and a reminder of what an incredible
talent Cube is, and what great producers the Bomb Squad were. Chicken Dinner!
