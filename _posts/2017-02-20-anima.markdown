Anima are krautrock with a capital K. Their first album (this one) is two side
long tracks (one in the studio, one "live"), both fully improvised and recorded
for the Pilz label way back when.

It falls into that category of perfectly pleasant music with some bits of
life but nothing I particularly want to hear ever again. The studio bit is somewhat
all over the place, all whispers and noise. The live side is a little better but
they never really get going enough to make things interesting. Nice cover
though.
