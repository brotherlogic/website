What to say, how to start. This year I am listening to 10 records on Vertigo, 10 Rap records that I've overlooked, 10 unknown Krautrock records and 10 records recommended by friends. So I start with Gracious on Vertigo. Now I always thought this record was called '!' but apparently not - it's just self titled and like Neu!, Gracious! went with the exclamation mark to make a point. The Melody Maker review from 1970 says "They're Bach-ing up the wrong tree", which just says it all and also from Galactic Ramble is Simon Crisp saying that it fails to deliver. I can kind of see his point, but I loved this record quite a bit - the opening track is great, all start stop drums. This was something of a poster child for Gracious as it pops up everywhere. And though there are only five tracks, there's enough variety in there to make things interesting and there are bits of the Beatles, and bits of what was great about the 1970s that they really didn't seem to care about coming across as tea swirling nerds but rather just made this wonderful thing.

Some of it wavers a bit - there's a lot of meandering in Hell of all places, and as discussed widely it seems the Fugue track was not the best idea. But it's also so earnest that I can't help but like it. And there's enough craziness and heavy drums in the other tracks to make up for it. Winner.
