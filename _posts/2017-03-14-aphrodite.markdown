The book of revelation is weird, and so any record that is a rock interpretation
of it is going to be a weird one. And this flips between something close
to melancholy and then some heaviness. The Four Horsemen is heavy and details
the four horsemen in colour and what they have. Though, they claim the last
one is green and I think it's meant to be ashen. Ah well.

It's bonkers and weird and great. And veers between heavy rock and pretty
bonkers Peter Sellers type voice overs at points. It's great though.
