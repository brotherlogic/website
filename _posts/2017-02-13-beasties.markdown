I used to have this one, bought on CD from Fopp or similar when they used to do CDs for a fiver. I listened to it
a few times but never quite got it. I like the idea of The Beastie Boys, and I have a lot of time for Ill Communication
but something about them doesn't quite fit with me.

And this one, the producers delight, kicking off with Loran's Dance, should tick all the boxes but it just
doesn't quite Gel for me. And the week of listening to it has softened it a little for me but still I can't quite
behind the whole thing.

I like Egg Man, with the blend of Superfly and Hustler's Convention, and individually I got into some of the
tracks but as a whole I like it, I don't love it.
