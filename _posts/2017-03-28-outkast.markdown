Outkast, a hip hop group I know very little about so I decided to start at the beginning and I can kind
of see the appeal here, but not very strongly. The records okay, the beats are not up my street on
the whole and I'd rather there was a bit more crack and tempo. Some of it I liked, and some of it just
washed over me. Too long. Pah!
