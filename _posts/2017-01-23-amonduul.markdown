So onwards and inwards, towards Amon Duul. The myth of AD is well known, one hippie commune split into
two factions - The second lot went off and made heavy psych rock. The first lot...well perhaps less understood.
One big jam session that was split over three/four records and then that lovely dark folk number.

This is Collapsing, so one of the records from that jam session - I have another one (Psychedelic Underground),
on a Metronome reissue. Whilst that was relatively structured, this is all over the place. And certainly
sounds like a bunch of stuff that perhaps should have been edited together to get something more meaningiful.
But you know what - it almost works. Almost. It's all over the place but, like Faust, you can kind of get it
in a cut up art way. It's mainly drums and guitar, and lots of fuzz but it's not unpleasant despite the
pretty narrow range. It's pretty much the same track over and over, but it's almost a good one so I can
forgive all of it's flaws.
