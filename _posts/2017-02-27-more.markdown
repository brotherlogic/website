Pink Floyd - covered heavily (ish) in the previous 50 British Psyche records
has a standard cannon for me: The singles are brilliant, the first LP is okay,
the second LP is bordering on boring and then it's not worth bothering with
the rest of them. Syd was interesting but a little too indulgent but after he'd
gone they went a bit more boring. Kind of like how the Soft Machine get dull
after Volume 2.

But this is actually brilliant, and may be my favourite Floyd LP - It has a lot
of great things going for it. Two heavy songs which, get this, are actually
heavy - and pretty much deliver what you always wanted The Floyd to do - wig
out a little. And the experimental stuff is light if a little weak but it
chugs along at quite the pace.

And Cymbaline which I knew from the Hawkwind cover, is a lovely song. It's a bit
too long, coming in at 45 minutes, but that can be forgiven. A lovely little
record.
