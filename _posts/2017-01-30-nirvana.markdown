Not that Nirvana, ha ha ha. This is the next Vertigo entry, and it's a bit of a weird one all things said.
It's two tracks, with each track being made up of little bits of music - some good, some a little too
vaudeville and some just weird. There's a brief moment in the first track where everything gets heavy
and a pleasant ish wig out occurs. That bit was nice, but there was so much meandering in the rest of the track
that I could never get behind it properly.

The second side starts off furious but then peters out into more dull singer songwriter nonsense, and then
it's all over and entirely forgettable. Let us not forget the other track though, the one with the single
good bit in it. Man they had a lot of freedom in 70s.
